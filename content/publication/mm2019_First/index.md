abstract: "In recent years, more and more videos are captured from the first-
person viewpoint by wearable cameras. Such first-person video
provides additional information besides the traditional third-person
video, and thus has a wide range of applications. However, tech-
niques for analyzing the first-person video can be fundamentally
different from those for the third-person video, and it is even more
difficult to explore the shared information from both viewpoints. In
this paper, we propose a novel method for first- and third-person
video co-analysis. At the core of our method is the notion of “joint
attention”, indicating the learnable representation that corresponds
to the shared attention regions in different viewpoints and thus
links the two viewpoints. To this end, we develop a multi-branch
deep network with a triplet loss to extract the joint attention from
the first- and third-person videos via self-supervised learning. We
evaluate our method on the public dataset with cross-viewpoint
video matching tasks. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art
both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also demonstrate how the
learned joint attention can benefit various applications through a
set of additional experiments."
