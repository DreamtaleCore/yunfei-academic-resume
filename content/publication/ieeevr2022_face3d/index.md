abstract: "3D virtual face reconstruction from a single image has a variety ofusage in virtual reality. Existing methods can synthesize plausiblereconstructed virtual faces, but typically ignore the eye gaze infor-mation, which is critical in human-computer interaction of virtualreality. In this paper, we present an advanced method to reconstruct3D virtual face with eye gaze information from a single image. Thedifficulties mainly lie on the low reconstruction quality in the eyeregion and the lack of an efficient method to obtain precise eye gazeinformation. To deal with these problems, we decompose this taskinto two key steps, namely 3D face reconstruction with precise eyeregion and eye contact guided facial-rotation for eye gaze informa-tion. The first step is designed for precise eye region reconstructionthrough joint optimization on 3D face/eye shapes and textures. Thesecond step contains two key techniquesi.e., eye contact discrimina-tor and automatic eye contact search algorithm via gradient-basedoptimization, to perform both eye contact and gaze estimation si-multaneously.  Extensive experiments on different tasks manifestthe superior performance including MSE (30%), SSIM (17.85%),and PSNR (8.4%) in 3D face reconstruction task, and also produceslower angular errors (63.01%) in gaze estimation task comparedwith human annotations."
