abstract: "Deep neural networks have significantly improved
appearance-based gaze estimation accuracy. However, it
still suffers from unsatisfactory performance when gener-
alizing the trained model to new domains, e.g., unseen en-
vironments or persons. In this paper, we propose a plug-
and-play gaze adaptation framework (PnP-GA), which is
an ensemble of networks that learn collaboratively with the
guidance of outliers. Since our proposed framework does
not require ground-truth labels in the target domain, the
existing gaze estimation networks can be directly plugged
into PnP-GA and generalize the algorithms to new do-
mains. We test PnP-GA on four gaze domain adaptation
tasks, ETH-to-MPII, ETH-to-EyeDiap, Gaze360-to-MPII,
and Gaze360-to-EyeDiap. The experimental results demon-
strate that the PnP-GA framework achieves considerable
performance improvements of 36.9%, 31.6%, 19.4%, and
11.8% over the baseline system. The proposed framework
also outperforms the state-of-the-art domain adaptation ap-
proaches on gaze domain adaptation tasks."
