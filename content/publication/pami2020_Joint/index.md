abstract: "â€”Recent years have witnessed a tremendous increase of first-person
videos captured by wearable devices. Such videos record information 
from different perspectives than the traditional third-person view, 
and thus show a wide range of potential usages. However, techniques
for analyzing videos from different views can be fundamentally dif-
ferent, not to mention co-analyzing on both views to explore the 
shared information. In this paper, we take the challenge of 
cross-view video co-analysis and deliver a novel learning-based
method. At the core of our method is the notion of 'joint attention', 
indicating the shared attention regions that link the corresponding
views, and eventually guide the shared representation learning 
across views. To this end, we propose a multi-branch deep network,
which extracts cross-view joint attention and shared representation 
from static frames with spatial constraints, in a self-supervised and
simultaneous manner. In addition, by incorporating the temporal 
transition model of the joint attention, we obtain spatial-temporal 
joint attention that can robustly capture the essential information 
extending through time. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art 
on the standard cross-view video matching tasks on public datasets. 
Furthermore, we demonstrate how the learnt joint information can 
benefit various applications through a set of qualitative and 
quantitative experiments"
