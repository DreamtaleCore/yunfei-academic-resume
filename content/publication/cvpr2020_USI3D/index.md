abstract: Intrinsic image decomposition, which is an essential task in computer
  vision, aims to infer the reflectance and shading of the scene. It is
  challenging since it needs to separate one image into two components. To
  tackle this, conventional methods introduce various priors to constrain the
  solution, yet with limited performance. Meanwhile, the problem is typically
  solved by supervised learning methods, which is actually not an ideal solution
  since obtaining ground truth reflectance and shading for massive general
  natural scenes is challenging and even impossible. In this paper, we propose a
  novel unsupervised intrinsic image decomposition framework, which relies on
  neither labeled training data nor hand-crafted priors. Instead, it directly
  learns the latent feature of reflectance and shading from unsupervised and
  uncorrelated data. To enable this, we explore the independence between
  reflectance and shading, the domain invariant content constraint and the
  physical constraint. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real image
  datasets demonstrate consistently superior performance of the proposed method.
