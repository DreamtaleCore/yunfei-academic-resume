abstract: "Eye tracking provides an effective way for interaction in Augmented
Reality (AR) Head Mounted Displays (HMDs). Current eye tracking
techniques for AR HMDs require eye segmentation and ellipse
fitting under near-infrared illumination. However, due to the low
contrast between sclera and iris regions and unpredictable reflections,
it is still challenging to accomplish accurate iris/pupil segmentation
and the corresponding ellipse fitting tasks. In this paper, inspired
by the fact that most essential information is encoded in the edge
areas, we propose a novel near-eye image analysis method with edge
maps as guidance. Specifically, we first utilize an Edge Extraction
Network (E2-Net) to predict high-quality edge maps, which only
contain eyelids and iris/pupil contours without other undesired edges.
Then we feed the edge maps into an Edge-Guided Segmentation
and Fitting Network (ESF-Net) for accurate segmentation and ellipse
fitting. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in near-eye
image segmentation and ellipse fitting tasks, based on which we
present applications of eye tracking with AR HMD."
