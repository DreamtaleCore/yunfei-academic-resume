**PBRR** is a large scale, public dataset for raindrop removal of photo-realistic adherent raindrop images based on Cityscapes dataset. It contains two sub-dataset. In particular, the **PBRR-Spheric** dataset contains14875 data-samples using spherical crown mode; and the **PBRR-BÃ©zier** dataset includes 14875 data-samples using Orthogonal Bezier Curve model. Each data sample contains images with 50-70 raindrops with various but realistic appearances, a ground truth raindrop mask, and a ground truth raindrop-less image.
